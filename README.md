# CS300
DSA: Analysis and Design

In this course, given the task of developing a small program for a fictitious university that would store the following information:
  - Course ID
  - Course Description
  - Pre-requisite #1
  - Pre-requisite #2

In developing this program, we needed to make key decisions as to which data structure we would use to store and manipulate the given data.  The three primary data structures that we learned about in this course were:
  - Linked List
  - Hash Table
  - Binary Search Tree

In deciding which data structure to use, we needed to weigh several options.  First was the complexity of the code.  Given the application, we did not want to choose a data structure that would be overly complex for the problem at hand where a simpler solution would suffice.  On the other hand, we still wanted to be efficient and be able to run timely algorithms.  This is where the big O analysis came into play.  By setting all outside variables equal, we were able to analize the data structures and algorithms relative to one another in order to get a good handle on the efficiency and cost of each choice.

For me, this was a very enjoyable course and project to work on.  I really enjoyed getting "under the hood" and seeing how different datastructures operate with pointers and algorithms.  There were many times throughout the course that I came across a new topic that I was unfamiliar with and had to do some of my own research in order to get to a solution.  

Overall, this project and course has really given me a deeper understanding of programing.  It has also helped evolve the way I think about problems by allowing me to see the problem through the lense of the algorithm.  To date, this has been my most enjoyable course in the CS program at SNHU and I look forward to applying the things that I learned to future courses and problems.
